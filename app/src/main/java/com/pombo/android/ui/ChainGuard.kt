/**
 * Fingerprint confirmation in front of every transaction this app signs.
 *
 * On-chain actions here are not "sending crypto" — they are Streamr registry
 * writes (create/delete stream, permissions, metadata, storage) — but they all
 * spend POL from the user's wallet and several are irreversible, so each one
 * is worth an explicit, informed yes.
 *
 * Two layers, on purpose:
 *
 *  1. [approve] is called by the ViewModel per user action, so the prompt can
 *     say what the action is and what it costs.
 *  2. [holding] keeps that approval open for the duration of the action, and
 *     [isApproved] lets [com.pombo.android.bridge.PomboBridge] refuse any
 *     chain-writing bridge method that arrives outside one. That second layer
 *     is what makes the coverage exhaustive: a chain write added later, or one
 *     missed here, cannot go out silently — worst case it prompts on its own.
 *
 * A single user action costs several transactions (creating a channel is eight)
 * and each is retried, so the grant is scoped to the action rather than to one
 * transaction. Nothing is time-based: the window opens when the user confirms
 * and closes when the action returns.
