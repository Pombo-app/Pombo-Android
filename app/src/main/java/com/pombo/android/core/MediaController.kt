/**
 * P2P file transfer: the pull-based engine and the lifecycle of the media
 * partitions it needs.
 *
 * Pull-based, like the web. A leecher asks a NAMED seeder for a SPECIFIC piece
 * and the seeder answers; nobody pushes. That is what makes the number of
 * outstanding requests the flow control — the request is the credit — and what
 * lets a swarm work without any coordinator: every peer that finishes becomes a
 * seeder, and the file outlives the original sender.
 *
 * Ownership: this class holds transfer state and drives requests, but never
 * seals a payload itself. Everything it sends goes out through [Transport],
 * implemented by ChannelManager, so the one place that decides how a channel's
 * payload is encrypted stays the one place.
