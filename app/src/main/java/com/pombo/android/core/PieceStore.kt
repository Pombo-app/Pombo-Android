/**
 * On-disk storage for one file being transferred.
 *
 * DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM THE WEB. The web keeps every piece as its own
 * IndexedDB row keyed `[fileId, pieceIndex]` and concatenates them into a Blob
 * when the last one lands. Here a piece is written straight into a SPARSE FILE
 * at `index * PIECE_SIZE`, so:
 *
 *   - assembly is free — the file already IS the assembled result, and the
 *     "assemble" step is a rename rather than a second full-size copy;
 *   - a 500 MB transfer never needs 500 MB of memory to finish, which on a
 *     phone is the difference between working and being killed;
 *   - resume is automatic, because the bytes are already where they belong;
 *   - seeding reads out of the same file, so a completed download can serve
 *     without duplicating anything.
 *
 * Completion is tracked in a side bitmap file rather than inferred from the
 * data: a sparse file reads as zeros where nothing was written, which is
 * indistinguishable from a piece that is legitimately all zeros.
 *
 * All methods are safe to call from several threads — pieces arrive on the
 * WebView binder thread and a seeder may be reading while a leecher writes.
 * A single RandomAccessFile cannot be shared across a seek+write pair without
 * that lock.
